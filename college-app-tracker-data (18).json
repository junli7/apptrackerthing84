      "text": "To avoid steep go-kart prices, my friend and I decided, why not try to make one? Our cheap welder and amateur skills resulted in some questionable welds and a floor made of a piece of sheet metal that rattled with a noise rivaling marching bands. In fact, the vibration was unscrewing the bolts. After our first fix failed, we added some grommets, and the bolts stayed tight. Building this go-kart has taught me something; I am not afraid to fail. That is how problems are identified and solved.\n\nThis learned process of finding problems is also how I learned my most important language. My most important community consists of just two people: my little brother Ryan and me. Ryan has a rare neurological condition and can’t speak, so I’ve learned to be his translator. For years, the incessant two-tone beep of his feeding pump was background noise. But I read Ryan’s reactions: the slight wince at the beep, the annoyance from being tethered for hours. I could see he was telling us it was a bad design.\n\nBeing his interpreter meant I needed to be his advocate. There had to be something better. My research led me to Bolus feeding with a syringe: it was faster, had fewer points of failure, and was silent. The solution wasn’t actually hard to find; the hard part was that we had all learned to stop looking for one. We had accepted that incessant beep as a fact of life. I brought it up to my parents, and with the approval of my brother’s doctors, we made the change. The silence was immediate, but the real proof was Ryan’s smile. My brother taught me that being empathic isn’t only passive; it’s a reason to take initiative.\n\nI took my experiences to new academic areas. My experience at SAMS proved I was ready for a highly academic environment. There, I got my first chance to step into that world. In my polymer chemistry lab, I was given the vocabulary for my past failures. The brittle plastic on my robots, the shoddy welds on the go-kart, were pieces of chemistry and materials science. SAMS taught me that my hands-on background isn't a negative; it can be a foundation for building deeper learning.\n\nAfter the whiteboard has been filled with ambitious ideas and the excitement is palpable, I like to ask my robotics team this: So, what’s the first step? My experiences taught me to be a self-starter. I know the difference between just imagining something and taking the first step to make it real, and how easy it is to start dreaming. In the Honors College Forum, as we tackle complex challenges, I will be the voice that turns shared ambition into that first, practical step. In the Rutgers Honors College, I will bring the hands-on persistence from the go-kart, the empathy from fixing the two-tone beep, and the practical leadership to help the community turn its vision into reality by pushing for that first step.",

      "text": "Purdue has the ideal environment for me to develop my philosophy of human-centered engineering. Academically, I plan to take the Design and Innovation minor, where I’ll take courses like TECH 34000 - Prototyping Technology For People, to provide a formal framework for the user factors I’ve explored in my personal projects. After spending four years making robots in my high school club, I know I like robots, which is why I was excited to see the CoMMA Lab at Purdue. I can put my love for robotics into a setting that integrates humanity and technology through its Human-Robot Collaboration focus. \n\nAt heart, I am a builder, and I love to experiment with new ideas. Purdue’s Bechtel Innovation Design Center is perfect for me. There, I will be able to collaborate with people who love to tinker as much as I do, and receive formal guidance on ways to turn my ideas into reality. My experience building things for others has made me wonder what is possible with robots working alongside us, which is why I’d like to join the Humanoid Robot Club and contribute to its ambitious goals. Furthermore, my work creating a program to help seniors with their devices taught me that I often learn more than I teach, a dynamic I hope to continue through EPICS. At Purdue, I will not only build better machines but also become a better, more thoughtful engineer.\n\n",

      "text": "I’d like to study Multidisciplinary Engineering in the Visual Design Track because of my dog. With only two hands, I had a truly impossible dilemma: my dog's big-eyed begs for fetch or my homework. Since commercial launchers only work with balls and Teddy is devoted to his floppy penguin plushie, I invented another option. Using a 3D printer and an Arduino, I created The Launcher from gears and motors. Toss a toy in, and it’d take off. But my dog had no idea how to use it. I still had to interrupt my work and place it in myself. \n\nIn building this, I realized that the functionality of my invention was irrelevant if it couldn’t be used. That’s the engineering I want to pursue: a mix of physics and thoughtfulness that turns parts into something a person (or dog!) can use.\n\nThis is why I am so drawn to Purdue’s Visual Design Engineering. It is one of the only programs I’ve found that treats form and function as a single challenge. It gives me the background to bridge human factors, aesthetic design, and robust mechanical principles into one field of study. \n\nI am choosing the West Lafayette campus because a program so interdisciplinary thrives on proximity. To really bridge human factors and robust mechanical principles, I need to be surrounded by the core engineering labs, makerspaces like the Bechtel Center, and a high concentration of students and faculty from all disciplines. West Lafayette is where those cross-disciplinary interactions happen.\n",
